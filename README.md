# Utility_Electricty_contract_selection_making_decision
 Our electricity contract is due for renewal and being a data analyst we decide to identify which contract will minimize our annual electricity cost

There are 3 different types of electricity contracts available: 
 * **No Flex:** The cost per kWh of electricity is constant for the entire year 
* **Monthly Flex:** The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates depending on the month 
* **Hourly Flex:** The cost per kWh of electricity fluctuates based on the time of day 

To decide which contract is optimal, we decide to compare the costs under each of the contracts assuming usage remains the same as in recent years. In the data the hour field identifies when the hour starts, so 8 AM would be from 8:00 AM until 8:59 AM
